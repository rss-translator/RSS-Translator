# Security Policy

If you think you have identified a security issue with a Pydantic project, do not open a public issue.

To responsibly report a security issue, please navigate to the "Security" tab for the repo, and click "Report a vulnerability".

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address the issue faster.

Thank you.
