## Why is some content not translated

1. check if you have set a maximum number of entries, this value limits the number of translations
2. If you use free translation engines, such as Google Translate and DeepLX, the original content will be displayed as it is easy to fail to translate due to the rate limitation. It is recommended to use paid translation engines for translation

## My Reading can't subscribe to the translated address

1. Check the translation status in the RSS translator to see if it is complete.
2. Use your browser to access the address if it works
3. your reader may not be able to access the RSS Translator, check if your RSS Translator is set to open to the public.

If you want to listen to IPv6 addresses instead, just modify the deploy/start.sh file, change `0.0.0.0` to `::`, and restart the service.
